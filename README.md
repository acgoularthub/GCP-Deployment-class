# Automating the Deployment of Infrastructure Using Deployment Manager

Deployment Manager is an infrastructure deployment service that automates the creation and management of Google Cloud resources. Write flexible template and configuration files and use them to create deployments that have a variety of Cloud Platform services, such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, and Cloud SQL, configured to work together.

In this lab, you create a Deployment Manager configuration with a template to automate the deployment of Google Cloud infrastructure. Specifically, you deploy one auto mode network with a firewall rule and two VM instances, as shown in this diagram:
